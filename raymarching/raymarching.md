# Raymarching

Raymarching is quite the ubiquious technique for representing volumes, mostly due to the straightworward & simple implementation, and the flexiblity that it presents, being able to render a isosurface or a spectral representation without changing nothing more than 2 lines.

But the cost of iteration is rather high, ending in a lot of texture sampling for each sample; and that being applied to mobile, I am expecting poor perfomance, due to the memory bandwith limitations.

## Result



| Perspective | Fragment count | Frametime (FPS) |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
|             |                |                 |
|             |                |                 |
